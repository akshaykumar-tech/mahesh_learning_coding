# To deploy your Ruby on Rails application to AWS from your local machine, you'll need to follow several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

# Set Up an AWS Account: If you don't already have an AWS account, sign up for one at https://aws.amazon.com/.

# Launch an EC2 Instance:

# Log in to your AWS Management Console.
# Navigate to the EC2 service.
# Launch a new EC2 instance. Choose an appropriate instance type, such as t2.micro.
# During the launch process, you can configure security groups and key pairs. Make sure to associate your existing .pem key pair with the instance.
# Connect to Your EC2 Instance:

# Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance from your local machine. Replace <path-to-your-pem-file> and <public-ip> with the appropriate values:
# arduino
# Copy code
# ssh -i /home/dev/Downloads/demoapp.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
# Set Up Your Environment on EC2:

# Update the system and install necessary packages on your EC2 instance:
# r
# Copy code
# sudo yum update -y
# sudo yum install -y git ruby ruby-devel nodejs gcc-c++ sqlite-devel
# Install Ruby on Rails on your EC2 instance. You can use rbenv or rvm for Ruby version management. Follow the installation instructions for your preferred method.
# Clone Your Rails Application:

# Use git to clone your Rails application repository onto your EC2 instance:
# bash
# Copy code
# git clone https://github.com/akshaykumar-tech/mahesh_learning_coding.git
# Install Dependencies:

# Navigate to your application's directory and install Ruby dependencies using Bundler:
# bash
# Copy code
# cd mahesh_learning_coding
# gem install bundler
# bundle install --without development test
# Set Up Your Database:

# Configure your database settings in config/database.yml.
# Run database migrations to create the database schema:
# bash
# Copy code
# bundle exec rake db:migrate
# Start Your Rails Application:

# Start your Rails application server. You can use a tool like screen to run it in the background:
# css
# Copy code
# screen -S rails
# rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -d
# Configure Security Groups:

# Ensure that your EC2 instance's security group allows incoming traffic on port 3000 (or the port your Rails application is running on).
# Access Your Application:

# Open a web browser and enter the public IP address of your EC2 instance followed by :3000 (or the port your Rails app is running on):
# vbnet
# Copy code
# http://<public-ip>:3000
# That's a high-level overview of the steps to deploy your Rails application on AWS EC2. Be sure to configure your production environment settings, including database configuration and secret keys, properly for security and performance in your config/application.yml or other appropriate files.

# Please note that for production use, it's recommended to use a web server like Nginx or Apache in front of your Rails application server (e.g., Puma or Unicorn) and to configure a production-ready database like PostgreSQL. Additionally, you should consider using a process manager like systemd or a tool like Capistrano for deployment automation.
